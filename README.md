## What is it?

piezo is a static site generator library that:

* Converts a directory of js or plain text files to a single-page site with a fallback to pre-rendered html
* Outputs a fully static site (complete with an updated sitemap.xml) that is SEO friendly and ready to deploy on any web host
* Automatically optimizes your production app with best practices like minification and code splitting

piezo optimized your workflow by:

* Encouraging code reuse via React components
* Hot reloading your entire site in development mode

## Ease of use

piezo is designed to allow developers and non-developers to collaborate on a website.

piezo requires no complex webpack or routing configuration, you only need to provide a very simple project structure

## What about other static generators?

Many other react-powered static site generators blur the lines between a library and a boilerplate.

piezo aims to handle the low level generation logic and provide a strong foundation for your own site with minimal configuration.

## Should I use piezo?

If you'd like to build a site using:

* react + react-router
* es2016 + webpack 2.0 (with tree shaking)
* postcss + css modules

And not worry about configuration, piezo might be a good fit.
